## Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
You can clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Google-Drive-Clone.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd Drive
npm install
```

### 3. Running the Project Locally

To run the project locally for development, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a local development server at \`http://localhost:3000\`. You can open this URL in your browser to see the application in action.

### 4. Build for Production
If you're ready to deploy the application to production, you can build the optimized production version of the app with:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a \`build/\` folder containing the static files, which you can then deploy to your web server.
